# Flower-Recognition-with-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing different classes of flowers. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and is designed to classify flower images into one of five classes.
<h2>Introduction</h2> 
The Flower Recognition project uses a CNN to classify images of flowers. The dataset contains 745 images belonging to 5 different classes. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
